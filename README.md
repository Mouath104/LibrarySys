# LibrarySys
A Library App for shcool

# About
The Library App is a web-based application designed to facilitate the work of librarians. It allows the librarian to issue books to students and specify the expiration date automatically by the system. The application maintains a table that contains all issued books with their respective students, including their status as valid or expired.

Key Features
- Book issuance: The librarian can issue a book to a student, and the expiration date is specified by the system automatically.
- Edit Profiles: Users can edit their profiles and change their passwords.
- Responsive design: The app is optimized for different screen sizes and devices.
- Availability Check: Prevent Issuing Already Issued Books. If the Book has been already issued, it won't be available to issue later, unless the Librarian removes it from the Issued Books table.
